                As we progress into the 21st Century, our average global surface temperature has increased by 0.32
                degrees Fahrenheit each decade since the 1981. Each decade's elevating temperatures have had a devastating
                impact on communities all across the world, whether it be victims of Hurricane Sandy or Dorian who were
                impacted by the increased storm surge severities and the increased frequency of tropical storms, or the
                monsoon season in August leading to flooding in parts of Pakistan, to glacial landslides in Alaska and
                Greenland caused by global warming. Each of these hazards will become only more prevalent as the China,
                the United States, and countries in Europe continue to release greenhouse gases into the environment such
                as Methane and Carbon Dioxide, which trap more solar energy in the Earth's Atmosphere (Albedo) with each
                passing year.<br><br>

                To measure the impact of our changing climate, you as a user can compare data on changing glacier density,
                sea level, and global surface temperatures to search for relationships between different systems in the
                atmosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere of Earth. With each of these searches, you have three options:
                create a graph to display the data for one variable and location (Ex. Glacier Density in Greenland from
                2014-2019), create a graph comparing two variables or locations for one variable or location
                (Ex. Comparing Surface Temperature Average and Rising Sea Level Differences in Iceland), or you can
                compare two different variables between two different locations (Ex. Glacier Density in Antarctica to
                Rising Sea Level in Australia). Each of these options can be selected from the input bars below.<br><br>

                However, each of these variables does not have the same amount of data.
                Current Glacial Density Data contains data from many countries and continents around the world such as
                Antarctica, Nepal, and Pakistan among others from dates between 1950-2010, but data retrieved on glacier
                density varies from 5-6 dates for one country, to thousands of data points in others. Current Average
                Surface Temperature Data this website contains data for the countries of Canada, Chile, Greenland,
                Iceland, Pakistan, and the United States of America between the years of 1901 to 2021. Each of these
                countries are the same for Sea Level Data, however the website database only contains data from between
                1993 and 2021. However, the graphs created in the website account for this.<br><br>

                As an example of each of these input options, below are three examples of each of the possible input options.

                (Optional) Location Two:<br>
                Variable: Sea Level<br>
                (Optional) Variable Two: Average Surface Temperature<br>

            <div>
                Example Three: Comparing Glacial Density Data in Antarctica and Sea Level Data in Greenland between 2000 and 2020, retrieved from entering the following:<br>
                Location: Antarctica<br>
                (Optional) Location Two: Greenland<br>
                Variable: Glacier Density<br>
                (Optional) Variable Two: Sea Level<br>
                Time Period: From 2000 To 2020<br>
                <br><a onclick="getValues('Antarctica', 'Greenland', 'Glacier Density', 'Sea Level', 2000, 2020)" href="{{ url_for('climateChangeUserInterfaceHomePage') }}">View Graphs/Data</a><br><br>
                (Remember, for two variables and two countries, the first location matches with the first variable <br>and the second location matches with the second variable!!)
