<h2>Climate Change Cause-Comparison Database</h2>

<h4>A Database Graphing Project presented on an HTML Interface, made using 
Python, SQL, and the Flask, Pandas, NumPy and Plotly Python Packages</h4>

Developed by: Samuel Clear<br>
Created on: November 15th, 2022

Our world has greatly changed over the last 40 years from the greatly-expanding 
carbon dioxide emissions, raising the global temperature by 1.28 degrees 
Fahrenheit since the early 1980s. Global warming has various impacts on the 
environment such as glacier melt, sea level rise, and surface level temperature 
increase. I created this Database Interface to show the user how each of these 
impacts on the environment are correlated by graphing data from each of these 
countries together that have significant portions of coastal land and glaciers, 
as well as comparing data from different countries to see how changes in 
different country's environments impacts the world as a whole.

To utilize this database, the user must log into the site with a Username and 
Password contained within the USERS database. <br>For admin privileges in the 
site, use the simple username "test1" and the simple password "test2". This 
allows you to directly add and remove entries from the database, as well as 
query directly into the database to see all entries in a table format with 
the Plotly package and Javascript functions. This option is hidden if you 
are in the standard user mode. <br>For standard user privileges, enter the 
username "JosieSmith572" and the password "greenPearFour35?". This mode 
shows you the home page with only the graphing option and the the ability to 
add more suggestions for new countries to add data for! <br>Each option allows 
for you to graph data for different environmental factors given, such as the 
maximum glacial elevation of Chile compared with the surface temperature of 
Chile from 1990 to 2000. The different environmental impacts, countries, and 
timelines of each factor can be modified in the input boxes for plotting a 
graph, with input validation according to each country's data recorded in 
the database. For further explanation of using the graphing input aspects of 
this interface, I have included test cases for entering data and a 
description of the process in the home page of the webpage.

This project has data from the the World Glacial Monitoring Service and the World 
Bank Group, and I hope to put more data into this database from other websites 
and organizations online in time. I especially would like to add more data on 
surface temperatures of water around the world to show how these rising in sea 
water temperatures are impacted by the increase in the surface temperature and 
possibly impact the rising sea level and the increase in extreme weather events 
such as tropical storms and hurricanes across the world.
